    Relief where too high a Court-fee has been paid.—Where 
    any person on applying for the probate of a will or letters of 
    administration has estimated the property of the deceased to be of greater 
    value than the same has afterwards proved to be, and has consequently paid 
    too high a Court-fee thereon, if within six months after the true value of 
    the property has been ascertained, such person produces the probate or 
    letters to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority 

    1[for the local area] 
    in which the probate or letters has or have been granted, 
 
and delivers 
    to such Authority a particular inventory and valuation of the property of 
    the deceased, verified by affidavit or affirmation, 
 
and if such 
    Authority is satisfied that a greater fee was paid on the probate or letters 
    than the law required,

    authority may—

*[<number>19B</number> Relief 
    where debts due from a deceased person have been paid out of his estate.—Whenever 
    it is proved to the satisfaction of such Authority that an executor or 
    administrator has paid debts due from the deceased to such an amount as, 
    being deducted out of the amount or value of the estate, reduces the same to 
    a sum which, if it had been the whole gross amount or value of the estate, 
    would have occasioned a less Court-fee to be paid on the probate or letters 
    of administration granted in respect of such estate than has been actually 
    paid thereon under this Act, 
 
such Authority 
    may return the difference, provided the same be claimed within three years 
    after the date of such probate or letters. 
 
But when, by 
    reason of any legal proceeding, the debts due from the deceased have not 
    been ascertained and paid, or his effects have not been recovered and made 
    available, and in consequence thereof the executor or administrator is 
    prevented from claiming the return of such difference within the said term 
    of three years, the said Authority may allow such further time for making 
    the claim as may appear to be reasonable under the circumstances.

    the same Act when a like grant is made in respect of the whole or any part 
    of the same property belonging to the same estate.
 
Whenever such 
    a grant has been or is made in respect of any property forming part of an 
    estate, the amount of fees then actually paid under this Act shall be 
    deducted when a like grant is made in respect of property belonging to the

    afterwards proved to be, and has in consequence paid too low a Court-fee 
    thereon, the Chief Controlling Revenue-Authority

    of the estate of the deceased being verified by affidavit or affirmation,

    payment of the full Court-fee which ought to have been originally paid 
    thereon in respect of such value and of the further penalty, if the probate 
    or letters is or are produced within one year from the date of the grant, of 
    five times, or if it or they is or are produced after one year from such 
    date, of twenty times, such proper Court-fee, without any deduction of the 
    Court-fee originally paid on such probate or letters:
 
Provided that, 
    if the application be made within six months after the ascertainment of the 
    true value of the estate and the discovery that too low a Court-fee was at 
    first paid on the probate or letters, and if the said Authority is satisfied 
    that such fee was paid in consequence of a mistake or of its not being known 
    at the time that some particular part of the estate belonged to the 
    deceased, and without any intention of fraud or to delay the payment of the 
    proper Court-fee, the said Authority may remit the said penalty, and cause 
    the probate or letters to be duly stamped on payment only of the sum wanting 
    to make up the fee which should have been at first paid thereon. ]
