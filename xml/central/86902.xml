    that is to say a warranty by which the assured undertakes that some 
    particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall be

 </section><section>
<number>3</number> A 
    warranty, as above defined, is a condition which must be exactly complied 
    with, whether it be material to the risk or not. If it be not so complied 
    with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy the insurer is 
    discharged from liability as from the date of the branch of warranty but 
    without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.

In estimating the cost of repairs, no

    an acceptance. 
 </section><section>
<number>6</number> Where 
    notice of abandonment is accepted the abandonment is irrevocable. The

<number>66</number> General 
    average loss.—
<section><number>1</number> A general 
    average loss is a loss caused by or directly consequential on a general 
    average act. It includes a general average expenditure as well as a general 
    average sacrifice. 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> There is a 
    general average act where any extraordinary sacrifice or expenditure is 
    voluntarily and reasonably made or incurred in time of peril for the purpose 
    of preserving the property imperilled in the common adventure. 
 </section><section>
<number>3</number> Where 
    there is a general average loss, the party on whom it falls is entitled, 
    subject to the conditions imposed by maritime law, to a ratable contribution 
    from the other parties interested, and such contribution is called a general 
    average contribution. 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> Subject to 
    any express provision in the policy, where the assured has incurred a 
    general average of expenditure, he may recover from the insurer in respect 
    of the proportion of the loss which falls upon him; and in the case of a 
    general average sacrifice, he may recover from the insurer in respect of the 
    whole loss without having enforced his right of contribution from the other 
    parties liable to contribute. 
 </section><section>
<number>5</number> Subject to 
    any express provision in the policy, where the assured has paid, or is 
    liable to pay, a general average contribution in respect of the interest 
    insured, he may recover therefor from the insurer. 
 </section><section>
<number>6</number> In the 
    absence of express stipulation, the insurer is not liable for any general 
    average loss or contribution where the loss was not incurred for the purpose 
    of avoiding, or in connection with the avoidance of a peril insured against. 
 </section><section>
<number>7</number> Where 
    ship, freight, and cargo, or any two of those interests, are owned by the 
    same assured, the liability of the insurer in respect of general average 
    losses or contributions is to be determined as if those interests were owned 
    by different persons.

 <article>
<number>67</number> Extent 
    of liability of insurer for loss.—
<section><number>1</number> 
    The sum which the assured can recover in respect of a loss on a policy by 
    which he is insured, in the case of an unvalued policy to the full extent of 
    the insurable value or in the case of a valued policy to the full extent of 
    the value fixed by the policy, is called the measure of indemnity. 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> Where 
    there is a loss recoverable under the policy, the insurer or each insurer if 
    there be more than one, is liable for such proportion of the measure of 
    indemnity as the amount of his subscription bears to the value fixed by the 
    policy in the case of a valued policy, or to the insurable value in the case 
    of an unvalued policy.

    of this Act, and to any express provision in the policy, where there is a 
    total loss of the subject-matter insured— 
 <section>
<number>1</number>    if the policy be a valued policy, the 
    measure of indemnity is the sum fixed by the policy; 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number>    if the policy be an unvalued policy the 
    measure of indemnity is the insurable value of the subject-matter insured.

<number>69</number> Partial 
    loss of ship.—Where a ship is 
    damaged, but is not totally lost, the measure of indemnity subject to any 
    express provision in the policy, is as follows:— 
 <section>
<number>1</number>    where the ship has been repaired, the 
    assured is entitled to the reasonable cost of the repairs, less the 
    customary deductions, but not exceeding the sum insured in respect of any 
    one casualty; 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number>    where the ship has been only 
    practically repaired, the assured is entitled to the reasonable cost of such 
    repairs, computed as above, and also to be indemnified for the reasonable 
    depreciation, if any, arising from the unprepaired damage, provided that the 
    aggregate amount shall not exceed the cost of repairing the whole damage, 
    computed as above; 
 </section><section>
<number>3</number>    where the ship has not been repaired, 
    and has not been sold in her damaged state during the risk, the assured is 
    entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable depreciation arising from the 
    unrepaired damage, but not exceeding the reasonable cost of repairing such 
    damage, computed as above; 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number>    where the ship has not been repaired, 
    and has been sold in her damaged state during the risk, the assured is 
    entitled to be indemnified for the reasonable cost of repairing the damage,

<number>70</number> Partial 
    loss of freight.—Subject to any 
    express provision in the policy, where there is a partial loss of freight, 
    the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy 
    in the case of a valued policy or of the insurable value in the case of an 
    unvalued policy, as the proportion of freight lost by the assured bears to 
    the whole freight at the risk of the assured under the policy.

 <article>
<number>71</number> Partial

    of indemnity, subject to any express provision in the policy, is as 
    follows:— 
 <section>
<number>1</number>    where part of the goods, merchandise or 
    other movable insured by a valued policy is totally lost, the measure of 
    indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy as the insurable 
    value of the part lost bears to the insurable value of the whole, 
    ascertained as in the case of an unvalued policy; 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number>    where part of the goods, merchandise or 
    other movable insured by an unvalued policy is totally lost, the measure of 
    indemnity is the insurable value of the part lost, ascertained as in case of 
    total loss; 
 </section><section>
<number>3</number>    where the whole or any part of the 
    goods or merchandise insured has been delivered damaged at its destination, 
    the measure of indemnity is such proportion of the sum fixed by the policy 
    in the case of a valued policy, or of the insurable value in the case of an 
    unvalued policy, as the difference between the gross sound and damaged 
    values at the place of arrival bears to the gross sound value; 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number>    “Gross value” means the wholesale 
    price, or, if there be no such price, the estimated value, with, in either 
    case, freight, landing charges, and duty paid beforehand; provided that, in 
    the case of goods or merchandise customarily sold in bond, the bonded price 
    is deemed to be the gross value. “Gross proceeds” means the actual price 
    obtained at a sale where all charges on sale are paid by the sellers.

    Apportionment of valuation.—
<section><number>1</number> 
    Where different species of property are insured under a single valuation, 
    the valuation must be apportioned over the different species in proportion 
    to their respective insurable values, as in the case of an unvalued policy. 
    The insured value of any part of species is such proportion of the total 
    insured value of the same as the insurable value of the part bears to the 
    insurable value of the whole, ascertained in both cases as provided by this 
    Act. 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> Where a 
    valuation has to be apportioned, and particulars of the prime cost of each 
    separate species, quality, or description of goods cannot be ascertained, 
    the division of the valuation may be made over the net arrived sound values 
    of the different species, qualities, or descriptions of goods.

<section><number>1</number> 
    Subject to any express provision in the policy, where the assured has paid, 
    or is liable for, any general average contribution, the measure of indemnity 
    is the full amount of such contribution if the subject-matter liable to 
    contribution is insured for its full contributory value; but, if such 
    subject-matter be not insured for its full contributory value, or if only 
    part of it be insured, the indemnity payable by the insurer must be reduced 
    in proportion to the under-insurance, and where there has been a particular 
    average loss which constitutes a deduction from the contributory value, and 
    for which the insurer is liable, that amount must be deducted from the 
    insured value in order to ascertain what the insurer is liable to 
    contribute. 
 </section><section>
<number>2</number> Where the 
    insurer is liable for salvage charges the extent of his liabilities must be 
    determined on the like principle.

    the provisions of this Act relating to the measure of indemnity shall affect 
    the rules relating to double insurance, or prohibit the insurer from 
    disproving interest wholly or in part, or from showing that at the time of 
    the loss the whole or any part of the subject-matter insured was not at risk

    free from particular average under a specified percentage, a general average 
    loss cannot be added to a particular average loss to make up the specified 
    percentage. 
 </section><section>
<number>4</number> For the 
    purpose of ascertaining whether the specified percentage has been reached, 
    regard shall be had only to the actual loss suffered by the subject-matter 
    insured. Particular charges and the expenses of and incidental to 
    ascertaining and proving the loss must be excluded.

    otherwise made good, is followed by a total loss, the assured can only

<section><number>1</number> Where the

    of any apportionable part, of the subject-matter insured, he thereupon 
    becomes entitled to take over the interest of the assured in whatever may

    prejudice to this insurance; to the charges whereof we, the assurers, will 
    contribute each one according to the rate and quantity of his sum herein

And it is especially declared and agreed that

    and bind ourselves, each one for his own part, our heirs, executors, and 
    goods to the assured, their executors, administrators, and assigns, for the 
    true performance of the premises, confessing ourselves paid the 
    consideration due into us for this assurance by the assured, at and after

Rules for Construction of Policy
 


The following are the rules referred to by 
    this Act for the construction of a policy in the above or other like form, 
    where the context does not otherwise require:—
 


1. Lost and not lost.—Where the 
    subject-matter is insured “lost or not lost” and the loss has occurred 
    before the contract is concluded, the risk attaches unless, at such time the 
    assured was aware of the loss, and the insurer was not.
 


2. From.—Where the subject-matter is 
    insured “from” a particular place, the risk does not attach until the ship 
    starts on the voyage insured.
 


3. At and from.—(a) Where a ship is 
    insured “at and from” a particular place, and she is at that place in good 
    safety when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately.
 


(b)   If she be not at that place when the 
    contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she arrives there in 
    good safety, and unless the policy otherwise provides, it is immaterial that 
    she is covered by another policy for a specified time after arrival.
 


(c) Where chartered freight is insured “at and 
    from”, a particular place, and the ship is at that place in good safety when 
    the contract is concluded, the risk attaches immediately. If she be not 
    there when the contract is concluded, the risk attaches as soon as she 
    arrives there in good safety.
 


(d) Where freight, other than chartered 
    freight, is payable without special conditions and is insured “at and from” 
    a particular place, the risk attaches pro rata as the goods or merchandise 
    are shipped; provided that if there be cargo in readiness which belongs to 
    the ship-owner, or which some other person has contracted with him to ship, 
    the risk attaches as soon as the ship is ready to receive such cargo.
 


4. From the loading thereof.—Where 
    goods or other movables are insured “from the loading thereof”, the risk 
    does not attach until such goods or movables are actually on board, and the 
    insurer is not liable for them while in transit from the shore to the ship.
 


5. Safety landed.—Where the risk on 
    goods or other movables continues until they are “safely landed”, they must 
    be landed in the customary manner and within a reasonable time after arrival 
    at the port of discharge, and if they are not so landed the risk ceases.
 


6. Touch and stay.—In the absence of 
    any further license or usage, the liberty to touch and stay “at any port or 
    place whatsoever”, does not authorise the ship to depart from the course of 
    her voyage from the port of departure to the post of destination.
 


7. Perils of the Seas.—The term “perils 
    of the seas” refers only to fortuitous accidents or casualties of the seas. 
    It does not include the ordinary action of the winds and waves.
 


8. Pirates.—The term “pirates” includes 
    passengers who mutiny and rioters who attack the ship from the shore.
 


9. Thieves.—The term “thieves” does not 
    cover clandestine theft or a theft committed by any one of the ship’s 
    company, whether crew or passengers.
 


10. Restraint of Princes.—The term 
    “arrests, etc., of kings, princes, and people” refers to political or 
    executive acts, and does not include a loss caused by riot or by ordinary 
    judicial process.
 


11. Barratry.—The term “barratry” 
    includes every wrongful act wllfully committed by the master or crew to the 
    prejudice of the owner or, as the case may be, the chaterer.
 


12. All other perils.—The term “all 
    other perils” includes only perils similar in kind to the perils 
    specifically mentioned in the policy.
 


13. Average unless General.—The term 
    “average unless general” means a partial loss of the subject-matter insured 
    other than a general average loss, and does not include “particular 
    charges”.
 


14. Stranded.—Where the ship has 
    stranded, the insurer is liable for the excepted loses although the loss is 
    not attributable to the stranding, provided that when the standing takes 
    place the risk has attached and, if the policy be on goods, that the damaged 
    goods are on board.
 


15. Ship.—The term “ship” includes the 
    hull, material and outfit, stores and provisions for the officers and crew, 
    and, in the case of vessels engaged in a special trade, the ordinary 
    fittings requisite for the trade and also in the case of a steamship, the 
    machinery, boilers, and coals and engine stores, if owned by the assured and 
    also in the case of a ship driven by power other than steam, the machinery 
    and fuels and engine stores, if owned by the assured.
 


16. Freight.—The term “freight” 
    includes the profit derivable by a ship owner from the employment of his 
    ship to carry his own goods or movables as well as freight payable by a 
    third party, but does not include passage money.
 


17 Goods.—The term “goods” means goods 
    in the nature of merchandise, and does not include personal effects or 
    provisions and stores for use on board.
 


In the absence of any usage to the contrary, 
    deck cargo and living animals must be insured specially, and not under the 
    general denomination of goods.
