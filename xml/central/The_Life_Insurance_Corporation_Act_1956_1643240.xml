      appointed day, become an employee of the Corporation, and shall hold his 
      office therein by the same tenure, at the same remuneration and upon the

      the appointed day if this Act had not been passed, and shall continue to 
      do so unless and until his employment in the Corporation is terminated or 
      until his remuneration, terms and conditions are duly altered by the

 Provided that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply to 
      any such employee who has, by notice in writing given to the Central 
      Government prior to the appointed day, intimated his intention of not 
      becoming an employee of the Corporation.

      remuneration and the other terms and conditions of service applicable to 
      employees of insurers whose controlled business has been transferred to,

      interests of the Corporation and its policy-holders, a reduction in the 
      remuneration payable, or a revision of the other terms and conditions of 
      service applicable to employees or any class of them is called for, the

      other  law for the time being in force, or in any award, settlement

      reduction or otherwise) the remuneration and the other terms and 
      conditions of service to such extent and in such manner as it thinks fit;

      may terminate his employment by giving him compensation equivalent to 
      three months’ remuneration unless the contract of service with such 
      employee provides for a shorter notice of termination.  
 Explanation.—The compensation payable to an employee under this sub-section 
      shall be in addition to, and shall not affect any pension, gratuity, 
      provident fund money or any other benefit to which the employee may be 
      entitled under his contract of service.]

      or mainly in connection with the controlled business of an insurer 
      immediately before the appointed day the question shall be referred to the 
      Central Government whose decision shall be final.  
 </section><section><number>4</number> Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Disputes 
      Act, 1947 (14 of 1947), or in any other law for the time being in force, 
      the transfer of the services of any employee of an insurer to the 
      Corporation shall not entitle any such employee to any compensation under 
      that Act or other law, and no such claim shall be entertained by any 
      Court, Tribunal or other authority.

The 
    Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956
 

 
 

 
 


THE FIRST SCHEDULE
 


(See 
    section 16)
 


PART A
 



Principles  for  Determining  Compensation
 


The compensation to be given by the 
    Corporation to an insurer having a share capital on which dividend or bonus 
    is payable, who has allocated as bonus to policy-holders the whole or any 
    part of the surplus as disclosed in the abstracts prepared in accordance 
    with Part II of the Fourth Schedule to the Insurance Act in respect of the 
    last actuarial investigation relating to his controlled business as at a 
    date earlier than the Ist day of January, 1955, shall be computed in 
    accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, 
    whichever is more advantageous to the insurer.
 


Paragraph 1.—Twenty times the annual 
    average of the share of the surplus allocated to shareholders as disclosed 
    in the abstracts aforesaid in respect of the relevant actuarial 
    investigations multiplied by a figure which represents the proportion that 
    the average business in force during the calendar years 1950  to 1955 bears 
    to the average business in force during the calendar years comprised in the 
    period between the date as at which the actuarial investigation immediately 
    preceding the earliest of the relevant actuarial investigations was made and 
    the date as at which the last of such investigations was made.
 


Paragraph 2.—Half the amount payable 
    under paragraph 1 plus the paid-up capital or assets equivalent thereto, or, 
    in the case of a composite insurer that part of the paid-up capital or 
    assets equivalent thereto which has or have been transferred to and vested 
    in the Corporation under this Act less the amount, if any, of expenses or 
    losses or both capitalised by the insurer for the purposes of Form A in the 
    First Schedule to the Insurance Act.
 


Explanation 1.—For the purposes of 
    paragraph 1,—
 


(a)  “relevant actuarial investigations” means 
    such minimum number of latest actuarial investigations as at dates earlier 
    than the 1st day of January, 1955 (not being less than two in any case), as 
    would leave the period intervening between the date as at which the 
    actuarial investigation immediately preceding the first of such 
    investigations was made and the date as at which the last of such 
    investigations was made, to be not less than four years;
 


(b)  “average business in force” means the 
    average of total sums assured by the insurer (including any bonus) in 
    respect of his controlled business as on the 31st day of December of each of 
    the relevant calendar years.
 


Explanation 2.—For the purposes of 
    paragraph 1, where an insurer has allocated to shareholders more than 5 per 
    cent of any such surplus as is referred to therein, the insurer shall be 
    deemed to have allocated only 5 per cent of the surplus and where an insurer 
    has not allocated any such surplus to shareholders or has allocated to 
    shareholders less than 3.5 per cent of any such surplus, the insurer shall 
    be deemed to have allocated 3.5 per cent of the surplus.
 


Explanation 3.—In the case of any 
    insurer incorporated outside India, the annual average of the share of the 
    surplus allocated to shareholders for the purposes of paragraph 1 shall be 
    deemed to be the annul average of the surplus as disclosed in the abstracts 
    prepared in accordance with Part II of the Fourth Schedule to the Insurance 
    Act in respect of the relevant actuarial investigations multiplied by a 
    figure which is the average of the two figures mentioned below:—
 


(i)  a figure representing the proportion 
    which the share allocated to shareholders out of the surplus in respect of 
    the world business of the insurer (such share being computed subject to the 
    provisions of Explanation 2) bears to the whole of such surplus as 
    ascertained with reference to the last actuarial investigation relating to 
    such business as at a date earlier than the 1st day of January, 1955; and
 


(ii)  a figure representing the proportion 
    which the share allocated to shareholders out of the surplus in respect of 
    the world business of the insurer (such share being computed subject to the 
    provisions of Explanation 2) bears to the whole of such surplus as 
    ascertained with reference to the actuarial investigation relating to such 
    business immediately preceding the actuarial investigation referred to in 
    clause (i):
 


Provided that in the case of any such insurer 
    in respect of whom an order has been made under section 35 the amount 
    computed as follows shall be deemed to be the annual average of the 
    surplus:—
 


(a)  there shall be deducted from the annual 
    average of the surplus, interest at 3.5 per cent per annum for one year 
    calculated on the assets specified in any order made under sub-section (2) 
    of section 35;
 


(b)  with respect to the balance arrived at 
    under clause (a), there shall be computed an amount that bears the same 
    proportion to the said balance as the liability on policies appertaining to 
    the controlled business of the insurer, other than those expressed in any 
    foreign currency issued on the lives of persons who are citizens of India, 
    bears to the liability in respect of all policies appertaining to such 
    business, the liabilities on policies being computed as at the 31st day of 
    December, 1955, in accordance with the provisions contained in clause (b) of 
    the Second Schedule:
 


Provided further that—
 


(a)  in any case where the order made under 
    section 35 is with reference to sub-section (2) only, the preceding proviso 
    shall have effect as if clause (b) had been omitted therefrom; and
 


(b)  in any case where the order made under 
    section 35 is with reference to sub-section (3) only, the preceding proviso 
    shall have effect as if—
 


(i)   clause (a) had been omitted;
 


(ii)   in clause (b), the words, brackets and 
    letter  “with respect to the balance arrived at under clause (a)” had been 
    omitted; for the words “the said balance” the words “annual average of the 
    surplus” had been substituted; and for the words, brackets and letter “with 
    the provisions contained in clause (b) of”, the words and letter “with 
    method A specified in” had been substituted.
 


Explanation 4.—Where an insurer is an 
    insurer incorporated outside India whose paid-up capital is outside India—
 


(a)  the provisions contained in paragraph 1 
    shall have effect as if the words “less a sum equal to that part of the 
    paid-up capital of the insurer as may be determined by the Central 
    Government to be allocable to the controlled business of the insurer” were 
    inserted at the end of that paragraph; and
 


(b)  the provisions contained in paragraph 2 
    shall have effect as if,—
 


(i)   the words “without making the deduction 
    referred to in clause (a) of Explanation 4” had been inserted after the 
    words “half the amount payable under paragraph 1”; and
 


(ii)   the words beginning with “plus the 
    paid-up capital” and ending with “in the First Schedule to the Insurance 
    Act” had been omitted.
 

 
 


PART B
 


The compensation to be given by the 
    Corporation to an insurer having a share capital on which dividend or bonus 
    is payable who has not made any such allocation as is referred to in Part A 
    in respect of the last actuarial investigation as at a date earlier than the 
    1st day of January, 1955, shall be an amount equal to the value of the

Secondly, there shall be ascertained 
    the difference between the market value as at the 15th day of August, 1947,

    Part, or, where any such immovable property has been sold before the 19th 
    day of January, 1956, the difference between the market value thereof as at

    being in force, to the extent to which such deposits have become losses;
 


Fourthly, there shall be ascertained 
    the difference between the market value as at the 15th day of August, 1947, 
    of any shares in any company now carrying on business in West Pakistan held 
    by the displaced insurer and which had been acquired before the 15th day of 
    August, 1947, and the market value of such shares as at the 19th day of 
    January, 1956.
 


The amount of compensation to be given to the 
    displaced insurer under this Part shall be—
 


(a)  the amount which would have to be given 
    to him if this paragraph had not been enacted, plus
 


(b)  an amount which represents one-half of 
    the difference between the compensation which would have to be given to him 
    if to the value of the assets referred to in Paragraph 3 there had been 
    added the sum of the four items referred to in this Paragraph and with 
    respect to the liabilities referred to in Paragraph 4, the life insurance 
    fund had been increased by a like sum, and the compensation which would have 
    to be given to him if this Paragraph had not been enacted
 


or
 


            one-half of the paid-up capital of 
    the displaced insurer whichever is less.
