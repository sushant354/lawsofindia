 <article><number>18</number> 
      Tenure of service under the Act.—Every 
      person subject to this Act shall hold office during the pleasure of the 
      President.

 
 <section><number>i</number> No 
        restraint can be put on the pleasure of the President under the Act or 
        the Rules, regarding determination of services of members of defence 
        services and it is not necessary also to afford an opportunity of 
        hearing before passing order of dismissal; Wg. Cdr. Hazara Singh 
        v. Union of India, 1982 (1) SLR (Del) 623.
 </section><section><number>ii</number> 
        The mere use of the word ‘dismissal’ in an order of termination of 
        service under section 18 in exercise of the President’s pleasure does 
        not make the order positive. The word ‘dismissed’ be deemed to have been 
        used loosely and amounts to termination simplicity; Wg. Cdr. Hazara 
        Singh v. Union of India, 1982(1) SLR (Del) 623.
 </section><section><number>iii</number> 
        The pleasure of the President under section 18 to dismiss an Air Force 
        Officer need not be exercised personally. It can be exercised by a 
        Minister in accordance with the Government of India (Allocation of 
        Business) Rules, 1961; Hazara Singh v. Union of India, 
        1976 Lab IC 528 (Del): (1976) 1 SLR 340 (Del).
 </section><section><number>iv</number> 
        President can dismiss Air Force Officer under this section without 
        giving reasons or hearing; Hazara Singh v. Union of India, 
        1976 Lab IC 528: (1976) 1 SLR 340 (Del).
 </section><section><number>v</number> 
        Provisions of Sections 18 and 19 are not discriminatory merely because 
        power thereunder can be exercised by same authority; Hazara Singh 
        v. Union of India, 1976 Lab IC 528: (1976) 1 SLR 340

 <article>
<number>19</number> 
    Termination of service by Central Government.—Subject 
    to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder, 
    the Central Government may dismiss, or remove from the service any person 
    subject to this Act.

 
 <section>
<number>i</number> Under section 18, 
      the Presidential pleasure in relation to air forces is wholly untrammelled 
      and the President has unqualified power to dismiss an Air Force Officer, 
      without giving any reasons or any hearing. The President’s power under 
      section 18 is not controlled by section 19, nor can both of them be read 
      together, as they deal with two different speares of executive power, 
      namely that of the President having its foundation in the constitutional 
      provision and that of the Central Government which is a statutory power 
      conferred by section 19; Hazara Singh v. Union of India,

“Entrustment” means the 
      handing over of the property by lawful means. If the property is obtained 
      by trick, or by other unlawful means, then these cannot be said to have 
      committed an offence of criminal breach of trust, because in that case 
      there is practically no trust created by the owner of the property. But 
      there can be an alternative charge under section 221
<section><number>1</number> of the Code of 
      Criminal Procedure, but if once an offender is punished under section 420 
      of the Indian Penal Code the other charge cannot be sustained; State

    Power of criminal court to require delivery of offender.—
<section><number>1</number> 
    When a criminal court having jurisdiction is of opinion that proceedings 
    shall be instituted before itself in respect of any alleged offence it may, 
    by written notice, require the officer referred to in section 124 at his 
    option, either to deliver over the offender to the nearest magistrate to be 
    proceeded against according to law or to postpone proceedings pending a 
    reference to the Central Government.

 
 <subsection>
<number>i</number> There is a 
    distinction between written notice envisaged in section 125 and summon 
    ordinarily issued for the appearance of an accused. Summons are to be served 
    on the person concerned. The written notice on the other hand, according to 
    the discretion of the commanding officer can either be delivered to the 
    offender or to the nearest Magistrate for being proceeded against according 
    to law or to postpone proceedings pending reference to the Central 
    Government; S.R. Tripathi v. State of U.P., 1964(2) Cr LJ 184 
    (All).
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>ii</number> The issue of 
    summons instead of written notice amounts to non-compliance with the 
    provisions of section 125; S.R. Tripathi v. State of U.P., 
    1964(2) Cr LJ 184 (All).
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>iii</number> Where no written 
    notice is given to the commanding officer and only a summon is sent, there 
    is non-compliance with the provisions of section 125 and the summons deserve 
    to be quashed; S.R. Tripathi v. State of U.P., 1964(2) Cr LJ 
    184 (All).
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>iv</number> Handing over of the 
    custody of the accused to civil authorities in execution of warrant of 
    arrest issued by the criminal court indicates that the authorities did not 
    opt to try the accused by court-martial; Balbir Singh v. State of 
    Punjab, (1995) 1 SCC 90.

</section><section>
<number>2</number> 
    In every such case the said officer shall either deliver over the offender 
    in compliance with the requisition, or shall forthwith refer the question as

    determination of the Central Government whose order upon such reference

This section is confined

    deals with the word “order” whereas sub-section (2) with words “finding” and 
    “sentence”. The scheme of the Act suggests that the word “order” as used in 
    section 161(1), does not cover findings and sentences within the 
    contemplation of section 161(2); S.P.N. Sharma v. Union of India,
