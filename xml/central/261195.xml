dispute arises as to the amount of such reasonable expenses, the matter shall be 
referred to an 1[Electrical 
Inspector], and the decision of such Inspector shall be final:
 Provided that the licensee shall 
not be at liberty to take off or remove any such meter if any difference or 
dispute of the nature described in sub-section (6) has arisen until the matter 
has been determined as therein provided.
 </section><section><number>5</number> A consumer shall not connect 
any meter referred to in sub-section (1) with any electric supply-line through 
which energy is supplied by a licensee, or disconnect the same from any such 
electric supply-line
2[but he 
may by giving not less than forty-eight hours’ notice in writing to the licensee 
require the licensee to connect or disconnect such meter and on receipt of any 
such requisition the licensee shall comply with it within the period of the 
notice.]
 
3[(6) 
Where any difference or dispute arises as to whether any meter referred to in 
sub-section (1) is or is not correct, the matter shall be decided, upon the 
application of either party, by an Electrical Inspector; and where the meter 
has, in the opinion of such Inspector ceased to be correct, such Inspector shall 
estimate the amount of the energy supplied to the consumer or the electrical 
quantity contained in the supply, during such time, not exceeding six months, as 
the meter shall not, in the opinion of such Inspector, have been correct; but 
save as aforesaid, the register of the meter shall, in the absence of fraud, be 
conclusive proof of such amount or quantity:
 Provided that before either a 
licensee or a consumer applies to the Electrical Inspector under this 
sub-section, he shall give to the other party not less than seven days’ notice 
of his intention so to do.]
 </section><section><number>7</number> In addition to any meter which 
may be placed upon the premises of a consumer in pursuance of the provisions of 
sub-section (1), the licensee may place upon such premises such meter, maximum 
demand indicator or other apparatus as he may think fit for the purpose of 
ascertaining or regulating either the amount of energy supplied to the consumer, 
or the number of hours during which the supply is given, or the rate per unit of 
time at which energy is supplied to the consumer, or any other quantity or time 
connected with the supply:
 
Provided that the meter, indicator or apparatus shall not, in the absence of an 
agreement to the contrary be placed otherwise than between the distributing 
mains of the licensee and any meter referred to in sub-section (1):
 Provided also that, where the 
charges for the supply of energy depend wholly or partly upon the reading or 
indication of any such meter, indicator or apparatus as aforesaid, the licensee 
shall, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, keep the meter, indicator 
or apparatus correct; and the provisions of sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) shall 
in that case apply as though the meter, indicator or apparatus were a meter 
referred to in sub-section (1).
 Explanation.—A meter shall 
be deemed to be “correct” if it registers the amount of energy supplied, or the 
electrical quantity contained in the supply, within the prescribed limits of 
error, and a maximum demand indicator or other apparatus referred to in 
sub-section (7) shall be deemed to be “correct” if it complies with such 
conditions as may be prescribed in the case of any such indicator or other 
apparatus.

5[two 
or more] owners or occupiers of premises in or upon any street or part of a 
street within the area of supply or by the State Government or a local authority 
charged with the public lighting thereof, requiring the licensee to provide 
distributing mains throughout such street or part thereof, the licensee shall 
comply within six months with the requisition, unless,—
 


       (a)  where it is made by such owners or occupiers as aforesaid, the 
owners or occupiers making it do not, within fourteen clear days after the 
service on them by the licensee of a notice in writing in this behalf, tender to 
the licensee a written contract 
6[in 
a form approved by the State Government] duly executed and with sufficient 
security binding themselves to take, or guaranteeing that there shall be taken, 
a supply of energy for not less than two years to such amount as will in the 
aggregate 
6[assure 
to the licensee at the current rates charged by him, an annual revenue not 
exceeding fifteen per centum of the cost of the distributing mains (not

the requisition]; or
 


       (b)  where it is made by the State Government or a local authority, the 
State Government or local authority, as the case may be, does not, within the 
like period, tender a like contract binding itself to take a supply of energy 
for not less than seven years for the public lamps in such street or part 
thereof.
 


7[(2) 
Where any difference or dispute arises between the licensee and such owners or 
occupiers as to the sufficiency of the security offered under this clause, or as 
to the cost of the distributing mains or as to the amount of energy to be taken 
or guaranteed as aforesaid, the matter shall be referred to the Electrical 
Inspector and decided by him.]
 

(3) 
Every requisition under this clause shall be signed by the maker or makers 
thereof and shall be served on the licensee.
 

(4) 
Every requisition under this clause shall be in a form to be prescribed by rules 
under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910; and copies of the form shall be kept at 
the office of the licensee and supplied free of charge to any applicant.
 


VI. Requisition for supply to owners or occupiers in vicinity.—(1) 
Where, 8[after 
distributing mains have been laid down under the provisions of clause IV and 
clause V and the supply of energy through those mains or any of them has 
commenced,] a requisition is made by the owner or occupier of any premises 
situate within 
9[the 
area of supply] requiring the licensee to supply energy for such premises, the 
licensee shall, within one month from the making of the requisition, 
8[or 
within such longer period as the 
10[Electrical 
Inspector] may allow] supply, and, save in so far as he is prevented from doing 
so by cyclones, floods, storms or other occurrences beyond his control, continue 
to supply, energy in accordance with the requisition:
 


Provided, first, that the licensee shall not be bound to comply with any such 
requisition unless and until the person making it—
 


       (a)  within fourteen days after the service on him by the licensee of a 
notice in writing in this behalf, tenders to the licensee a written contract, in 
a form approved by the State Government, duly executed and with sufficient 
security, binding himself to take a supply of energy for not less than two years 
to such amount as will 
6[assure 
to the licensee at the current rates charged by him, an annual revenue not 
exceeding fifteen per centum of the cost of the service-line required to comply 
with the requisition], and
 


       (b)  if required by the licensee so to do, pays to the licensee the cost 
of so much of any service-line as may be laid down or placed for the purposes of 
the supply upon the property in respect of which the requisition is made, and of 
so much of any service-line as it may be necessary for the said purposes to lay 
down or place beyond one hundred feet from the licensee’s distributing main, 
although not on that property:
 


Provided, secondly, that the licensee shall be entitled to discontinue such 
supply—
 


       (a)  if the owner or occupier of the property to which the supply is made 
has not already given security, or if any security given by him has become 
invalid or insufficient, and such owner or occupier fails to furnish security or 
to make up the original security to a sufficient amount, as the case may be, 
within seven days, after the service upon him of notice from the licensee 
requiring him so to do, or
 


       (b)  if the owner or occupier of the property to which the supply is made 
adopts any appliance, or uses the energy supplied to him by the licensee for any 
purposes, or deals with it in any manner, so as unduly or improperly to 
interfere with the efficient supply of energy to any other person by the 
licensee, or
 


       (c)  if the electric wires, fittings, works and apparatus in such 
property are not in good order and condition, and are consequently likely to 
affect injuriously the use of energy by the licensee, or by other persons, or
 


       (d)  if the owner or occupier makes any alterations of, or additions to, 
any electric wires, fittings, works or apparatus within such property as 
aforesaid, and does not notify the same to the licensee before the same are 
connected to the source of supply, with a view to their being examined and 
tested; 
11[but the licensee shall re-connect the 
supply with all reasonable speed on the cessation of the act or default or both, 
as the case may be, which entitled him to discontinue it]:
 


                Provided, 
thirdly, that the maximum rate per unit of time at which the owner or occupier 
shall be entitled to be supplied with energy shall not exceed what is necessary 
for the maximum consumption on his premises, and, where the owner or occupier 
has required a licensee to supply him at a specified maximum rate, he shall not 
be entitled to alter that maximum, except after one month’s notice in writing to 
the licensee, and the licensee may recover from the owner or occupier any 
expenses incurred by him by reason of such alteration in respect of the 
service-lines by which energy is supplied to the property beyond one hundred 
feet from the licensee’s distributing main, or in respect of any fittings or 
apparatus of the licensee upon that property: and
 


                Provided, 
fourthly, that, 

12[if any requisition 
is made for a supply of energy and] the licensee can prove, to the satisfaction 
of an 

13[Electrical 
Inspector]—
 


            (a)  that 
14[the 
nearest distributing main] is already loaded up to its full current-carrying 
capacity, or
 


            (b)  that, in case of a larger amount of current being transmitted 
by it, the loss of pressure will seriously affect the efficiency of the supply 
to other consumers in the vicinity,
 

the 
licensee may refuse to accede to the requisition for such reasonable period, not 
exceeding six months, as such Inspector may think sufficient for the purpose of 
amending the distributing main or laying down or placing a further distributing 
main.
 

(2) 
Any service-line laid for the purpose of supply in pursuance of a requisition 
under sub-clause (1) shall, notwithstanding that a portion of it may have been 
paid for by the person making the requisition, be 
15[maintained 
by the licensee who shall also have the right to use it for the supply of energy 
to any other person].
 

(3) 
Where any difference or dispute arises as to the amount of energy to be taken or 
guaranteed as aforesaid, or as to the cost of any service-line or as to the 
sufficiency of the security offered by any owner or occupier, 
16[or 
as to the position of the meter board] or as to the improper use of energy, or 
to any alleged defect in any wires, fitting, works or apparatus, or as to the 
amount of the expenses incurred under the third proviso to sub-clause (1), the 
matter shall be referred to an 
17[Electrical 
Inspector] and decided by him.
 

(4) 
Every requisition under this clause shall be signed by the maker or makers 
thereof and shall be served on the licensee.
 

(5) 
Every requisition under this clause shall be in a form to be prescribed by rules 
under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910; and copies of the form shall be kept at 
the office of the licensee and supplied free of charge to any applicant.
 


18[VII. 
Further provisions as to laying of service-lines.—The licensee shall, before 
commencing to lay down or place a service-line in any street in which a 
distributing main has not already been laid down or placed, serve upon the local 
authority (if any) and upon the owner or occupier of all premises abutting on so 
much of the street as lies between the points of origin and termination of the 
service-line so to be laid down or placed twenty-one days’ notice stating that 
the licensee intends to lay down or place a service-line, and intimating that, 
if within the said period the local authority or 
19[any 
one or more] of such owners or occupiers require, in accordance with the 
provisions of the license, that a supply shall be given for any public lamps or 
to their premises, as the case may be, the necessary distributing main will be 
laid down or placed by the licensee at the same time as the service-line.]
 


VIII. Supply for public lamps.—(1) 
Where, 20[after 
distributing mains have been laid down under the provisions of clause IV or 
clause V and the supply of energy through those mains or any of them has 
commenced], a requisition is made by the State Government or by a local 
authority requiring the licensee to supply for a period of not less than seven 
years energy for any public lamps within the 
21[area 
of supply], the licensee shall supply, and, save in so far as he is prevented 
from doing so by cyclones, floods, storms or other occurrences beyond his 
control, continue to supply, energy for such lamps in such quantities as the 
State Government or the local authority, as the case may be, may require.
 


22[(1A) 
The State Government or, as the case may be, a local authority may require the 
licensee—
 


       (a)  to provide the mains and other equipments for public lamps, and
 


       (b)  to use for that purpose supports, if any, previously erected or set 
up by him for supply of energy.]
 

(2) 
The provisions of sub-clause (b) of the first proviso, of sub-clauses (c) and 
(d) of the second proviso and of the third and fourth proviso to sub-clause (1) 
and the provisions of sub-clauses (2) and (3) of clause VI shall, so far as may 
be, apply to every case in which a requisition for the supply of energy is made 
under this clause as if the State Government or local authority were on owner or 
occupier within the meaning of those provisions.
 


Supply by bulk-licensees
 


IX. Special provisions applying to supply by bulk-licensees.—(1) 
Where, and in so far as the licensee (hereinafter in this clause referred to as 
“the bulk-licensee”) is authorized by his license to supply energy to other 
licensees for distribution by them (hereinafter in this clause referred to as 
“distributing-licensees”), the following provisions shall apply, namely:—
 


       (a)  any distributing licensees within the bulk-licensee’s area of supply 
may make a requisition on the bulk-licensee, requiring him to give a supply of 
energy and specifying the point, and the maximum rate per unit of time, at which 
such supply is required, and the date upon which the supply is to commence, such 
date being fixed after the date of receipt of the requisition so as to allow an 
interval that is reasonable with regard to the locality and to the length of the 
electric supply-line and the amount of the plant required;
 


       (b)  such distributing-licensee shall, if required by the bulk-licensee 
so to do, enter into a written agreement to receive and pay for a supply of 
energy for a period of not less than seven years of such an amount that the 
payment to be made for the same at the rate of charge for the time being charged 
for such supply shall not be less than such an amount 
23[as 
will assume to the bulk-licensee an annual revenue not exceeding fifteen per 
centum of the outlay] (excluding expenditure on generating plant then existing 
and any electric supply-line then laid down or placed) incurred by him in making 
provision for such supply;
 


24[***]
 


          (d)  if any 
difference or dispute arises under this clause, it shall be determined by 
arbitration, and, in the event of such arbitration, the arbitrator shall have 
regard to the following amongst other considerations, namely:—
 


             (i)  the period for which the distributing-licensee is prepared to 
bind himself to take energy;
 


            (ii)  the amount of energy required and the hours during which the 
bulk-licensee is to supply it;
 


           (iii)  the capital expenditure incurred or to be incurred by the 
bulk-licensee in connection with the aforesaid supply of energy; and
 


           (iv)  the extent to which the capital expended or to be expended by 
the bulk-licensee in connection with such supply may become unproductive upon 
the discontinuance thereof.
 

(2) 
Notwithstanding anything in sub-clause (1), the bulk-licensee shall give a 
supply of energy to any distributing-licensee within his area of supply applying 
therefor, even although the distributing-licensee desires to be supplied with 
only a portion the energy required for distribution by him:
 


Provided that the distributing-licensee shall, if so required by the 
bulk-licensee, enter into an agreement to take such energy upon special terms 
(including a minimum annual sum to be paid to the bulk-licensee) to be 
determined, if necessary, by arbitration in the manner laid down in any clause 
(1)(d).
 

(3) 
The maximum price fixed by a licensee for energy supplied to a 
distributing-licensee shall not apply to any partial supply given under 
sub-clause (2).
 

(4) 
Every distributing-licensee, who is supplied with energy by a bulk-licensee and 
intends to discontinue to receive such supply, shall give not less than twelve 
months’ notice in writing of such intention to the bulk-licensee:
 


Provided that, where the distributing-licensee has entered into a written 
agreement with the bulk-licensee to receive and pay for a supply of energy for a 
certain period, such notice shall be given so as not to expire before the end of 
that period.
 


Charges
 


X. Methods of charging.—25[***]
 


26[(1)]
27[***] 
Where the licensee charges by any method 
28[approved 
by the State Government in accordance with section 23, sub-section (3), clause 
(c), of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910], any consumer who objects to that 
method may, by not less than one month’s notice in writing, require the licensee 
to charge him, at the licensee’s option, either by the actual amount of energy 
supplied to him or by the electrical quantity contained in the supply, and 
thereafter the licensee shall not, except with the consent of the consumer, 
charge him by another method.
 


29[(2)]
30[***] 
Before commencing to supply energy through any distributing main, the licensee 
shall give notice, by public advertisement, of the method by which he proposes 
to charge for energy so supplied; and, where the licensee has given such notice, 
he shall not be entitled to change that method of charging without giving not 
less than one month’s notice in writing of such change to the State Government
31[to 
the State Electricity Board and the local authority (if any) concerned and to 
the Electrical Inspector], and to every consumer of energy who is supplied by 
him from such distributing main.
 


32[(3)]
33[***] 
If the consumer is provided with a meter in pursuance of the provisions of 
section 26, sub-section (1), of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, and the 
licensee changes the method of charging for the energy supplied by him from the 
distributing main, the licensee shall bear the expense of providing a new meter, 
or such other apparatus as may be necessary by reason of the new method of 
charging.
 


34[***]
 


XII. Charge for supply for public lamps.—The 
price to be charged by the licensee and to be paid to him for energy supplied 
for the public lamps 
35[and 
other charges to be paid to him in connection therewith] and the mode in which 
those charges are to be ascertained, shall be settled by agreement between the 
licensee and the State Government or the local authority, as the case may be, 
and, where any difference or dispute arises, the matter shall be determined by 
arbitration.
 


Testing and inspection
 


XIII. Licensee to establish testing stations and keep instruments for testing.—The 
licensee shall establish at his own cost and keep in proper condition such 
number of testing stations, situated at such places within reasonable distance 
from any distributing main, as the State Government may direct for the purpose 
of testing the pressure or periodicity of the supply of energy in the 
distributing main, and shall supply and keep in proper condition thereat, and on 
all premises from which he supplies energy, such instruments for testing as an
36[Electrical 
Inspector] may approve, and shall supply energy to each testing station for the 
purpose of testing.
 


XIV. Facilities for testing.—The 
licensee shall afford 
35[to 
an Electrical Inspector or other person authorised by such Inspector] all 
facilities for inspection and testing of his works and for the reading, testing 
and inspection of his instruments, and may, on each occasion of the testing of 
his works or the reading, testing or inspection of any instruments, be 
represented by an agent; who may be present, but shall not interfere with the 
reading, testing or inspection.
 


XV. Testing of works.—On the occasion 
of the testing of any works of the licensee by an 
36[Electrical 
Inspector or a person authorised by him in this behalf (hereinafter referred to 
as the authorised person)] reasonable notice thereof shall be given to the 
licensee; and the testing shall be carried out at such suitable hours as, in the 
opinion of the 
6[Electrical 
Inspector or the authorised person] will least interfere with the supply of 
energy by the licensee, and in such manner as the 
36[Electrical 
Inspector or the authorised person] may think fit, but, except under the 
provisions of an order made in each case in that behalf by the State Government, 
the 36[Electrical 
Inspector or the authorised person] shall not be entitled to have access to, or 
interfere with, the works of the licensee at any points other than those at 
which the licensee himself has access to the same:
 


Provided that the licensee shall not be held responsible for any interruption or 
irregularity in the supply of energy which may be occasioned by, or required by 
the 37[Electrical 
Inspector or the authorised person] for the purpose of, any such testing as 
aforesaid:
 


Provided, also, that the testing shall not be made in regard to any particular 
portion of the works oftener than once in any three months, unless in pursuance 
of an order made in each case in that behalf by the State Government.
 


Plan
 


XVI. Plan of area of supply to made and kept open for inspection.—(1) 
The licensee shall, after commencing to supply energy, forthwith cause a plan to 
be made of the area of supply, and shall cause to be marked thereon the 
alignments 
38[and, 
in the case of underground works, the approximate depth] below the surface of 
all his then existing electric supply-lines, street-distributing boxes and other 
works, and shall once in every year cause that plan to be duly corrected so as 
to show the electric supply-lines, street-distributing boxes and other works for 
the time being in position. The licensee shall also, if so required by an 
37[Electrical 
Inspector] cause to be made sections showing the approximate level of all his 
existing underground works other than service-lines.
 


39[(2) 
Every plan shall be drawn to such scale as the State Government may require 
provided that no scale shall be required unless maps of the locality on that 
scale are for the time being available to the public.
 

(3) 
Every such section shall be drawn to horizontal and vertical scales which shall 
be such as the State Government may require.]
 

(4) 
Every plan and section so made or corrected, or a copy thereof, marked with the 
date when it was so made or corrected, shall be kept by the licensee at his 
principal office or place of business within the area of supply, and shall at 
all reasonable times be open to the inspection of all applicants, and copies 
thereof shall be supplied on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by 
rules under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.
 

(5) 
The licensee shall, if required by an 
37[Electrical 
Inspector] and, where the licensee is not a local authority, by the local 
authority (if any) concerned, supply free of charge to such 
37[Electrical 
Inspector] or local authority a copy of every such plan or section duly 
corrected so as to agree with the original kept at the principal office or place 
of business of the licensee.
 


Additional notice of certain works
 


XVII. Notice to Electrical Inspector.—On 
the day next preceding the commencement of any such works as are referred to in 
section 13 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the licensee shall, in addition 
to any other notices which he may be required to give, serve upon the 
37[Electrical 
Inspector], or such officer as the State Government may appoint in this behalf 
for the area of supply, a notice in writing stating that he is about to commence 
the works, and the nature and position of the same.
