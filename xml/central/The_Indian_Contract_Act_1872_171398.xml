    Voidability of agreements without free consent.—When 
    consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, 

    1[***] fraud or 
    misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the 
    party whose consent was so caused. —When 
    consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, 

    1[***] fraud or 
    misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the 
    party whose consent was so caused." 
 
A party 
    to contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if 
    he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he 
    shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the 
    representations made had been true.
 <section>

    <number>Exception</number>—If 
    such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent 
    within the meaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not 
    voidable, if the party whose consent was so caused had the means of 
    discovering the truth with ordinary diligence.
 

    Explanation.—A 
    fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of 
    the party on whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such 
    misrepresentation was made, does not render a contract voidable.

    ‘Bailment’, ‘bailor’ and ‘bailee’ defined.—A 
    ‘bailment’ is the delivery of goods by one person to another for some 
    purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, 
    be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the 
    person delivering them. The person delivering the goods is called the ‘bailor’. 
    The person to whom they are delivered is called the ‘bailee’. —A 
    ‘bailment’ is the delivery of goods by one person to another for some 
    purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, 
    be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the 
    person delivering them. The person delivering the goods is called the ‘bailor’. 
    The person to whom they are delivered is called the ‘bailee’." 
 

    Explanation.—If 
    a person is already in possession of the goods of other contracts to hold 
    them as a bailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner becomes the 
    bailor of such goods, although they may not have been delivered by way of 
    bailment.

    putting the goods in the possession of the intended bailee or of any person 
    authorised to hold them on his behalf. —The

    Bailor’s duty to disclose faults in goods bailed.—The 
    bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee faults in the goods bailed, of 
    which the bailor is aware, and which materially interfere with the use of 
    them, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make 
    such disclosure, he is responsible for damage arising to the bailee directly 
    from such faults.
 
If such 
    goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage, 
    whether he was or was not aware of the existence of such faults in the goods 
    bailed.
