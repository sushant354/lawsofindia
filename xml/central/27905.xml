    section referred to as export) of all goods or of any goods or class of 
    goods specified in the notification from India directly or indirectly to any 
    place so specified unless the exporter furnishes to the prescribed authority 
    a declaration in the prescribed form supported by such evidence as may be 
    prescribed or so specified and true in all material particulars which, among 
    others, shall include the amount representing—  
 <subsubsection>
<number>i</number>   the full export 
    value of the goods; or  
 </subsubsection><subsubsection>
<number>ii</number>   if the full export 
    value of the goods is not ascertainable at the time of export the value 
    which the exporter, having regard to the prevailing market conditions, 
    expects to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market,  
 
and affirms in the said 
    declaration that the full export value of the goods (whether ascertainable 
    at the time of export or not) has been, or will within the prescribed period 
    be, paid in the prescribed manner.
 </subsubsection></subsection><subsection>
<number>b</number> If 
    the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient in 
    the public interest so to do, it may, by notification in the Official 
    Gazette specified any goods, from among those goods to which a notification 
    under clause (a) applies, and direct that in respect of the goods so 
    specified, where an exporter makes a declaration under sub-clause (ii) of 
    clause (a) of the value which he having regard to the prevailing market 
    conditions expect to receive on the sale of such goods in the overseas 
    market, he shall not, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank on an 
    application made to the Reserve Bank by the exporter in this behalf, 
    authorise or permit or allow or in any manner be a party to, the sale of 
    such goods for a value less than that declared:  
 

    Provided that no permission shall be refused by the Reserve Bank under this 
    clause unless the exporter has been given a reasonable opportunity for 
    making a representation in the matter:  
 

    Provided further that where the exporter makes an application to the Reserve 
    Bank for permission under this clause and the Reserve Bank does not, within 
    a period of twenty days from the date of receipt of the application 
    communicate to the exporter that permission applied for has been refused, it 
    shall be presumed that the Reserve Bank has granted such permission.  
 

    Explanation.—In 
    computing the period of twenty days for the purposes of the second proviso, 
    the period, if any, taken by the Reserve Bank for giving an opportunity to

 </subsubsubsection></subsubsection><subsubsection>
<number>b</number>   that the proceeds

<number>B</number>   in a case falling

    Provided that no proceedings in respect of any contravention of the 
    provisions of this sub-section shall be instituted unless the prescribed

<number>3</number> 
    Where in relation to any goods to which a notification under clause (a) of 
    sub-section (1) applies the prescribed period has expired and payment

    person who has sold the goods or who is entitled to sell the goods or 
    procure the sale thereof, such directions as appear to it to be expedient

 <subsection>
<number>i</number>   if the goods have 
    been sold, the payment therefor, or  
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>ii</number>   if the goods have

within such period as the 
    Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf and without prejudice to the 
    generality of the foregoing provision, may direct that the goods, the right

    specified in the directions.

<number>5</number> 
    Where any goods or a right to receive payment or any other right to enforce 
    such payment, are or is transferred or assigned in accordance with 
    sub-section (4), the Central Government shall pay to the person transferring

    expenses incurred by the Central Government in selling the goods or in 
    recovering or realising the amount in respect of such goods.

<number>6</number> 
    Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (1), where the value of 
    the goods specified in the declaration furnished under that sub-section is 
    less than the amount which in the opinion of the Reserve Bank, in a case 
    falling under sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of that sub-section, represents 
    the full export value of those goods, or in a case falling under sub-clause 
    (ii) of that clause, the value which the exporter can, having regard to the 
    prevailing market conditions, expect to receive on the sale of the goods in 
    the overseas market, the Reserve Bank may issue an order requiring the 
    person holding the shipping documents to retain possession thereof until 
    such time as the exporter of the goods has made arrangements for the Reserve 
    Bank or a person authorised by the Reserve Bank to receive on behalf of the 
    exporter payment in the prescribed manner of an amount which in the opinion 
    of the Reserve Bank represents the full export value of such goods or the 
    value which the exporter, having regard to the prevailing market conditions, 
    can be expected to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market.  
 </section><section>
<number>7</number> 
    For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section

    may be, the value which the exporter having regard to the prevailing market 
    conditions, expects to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas 
    market, has been, or will within the prescribed period, be paid in the 
    prescribed manner.  
 </section><section>
<number>8</number> 
    Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (1), where the Reserve

    being a person who has signed the declaration in terms of sub-section (1)], 
    such authorised dealer shall, before accepting such documents for 
    negotiation or collection, require the constituent concerned also to sign 
    such declaration and thereupon such constituent shall be bound to comply 
    with such requisition and the original declarant and such constituent 
    signing the declaration shall each be considered to be the exporter for the 
    purposes of this section, and shall be governed by the provisions thereof 
    accordingly.

    export value of the goods or, as the case may be, the value which the 
    exporter, having regard to the prevailing market conditions, expects to 
    receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market, is received in 
    proper time or without delay, by general or special order, direct from time 
    to time, that in respect of export of goods to any destination or any class 
    of export transactions or any class of goods or class of exporters, the

    given subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may deem fit to impose:  
 

    Provided that no approval shall be withheld by the Reserve Bank under this 
    clause unless the exporter has been given a reasonable opportunity for 
    making a representation in the matter.

<number>10</number> 
    Where the Central Government is of opinion that, in respect of any goods or

    the effect that the goods will be sold on account of the exporter and the 
    account of such sales rendered to the exporter has resulted or is likely to 
    result in the full export value of the goods not being brought into India in 
    the prescribed manner or within the prescribed period, it may, by general or
