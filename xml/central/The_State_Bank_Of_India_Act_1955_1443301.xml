hundred and twenty-five shares, require the State Bank to issue to it such 
further shares as may be necessary to secure that it holds not less than 
fifty-five per cent. of the issued capital of the State Bank, and the State 
Bank shall, without prejudice to the provisions contained in sub-section (3) of 
section 5, comply with such requirement on the Reserve Bank subscribing one
