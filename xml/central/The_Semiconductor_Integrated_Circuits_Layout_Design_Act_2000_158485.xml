    incorporating such a semiconductor integrated circuit where such person does 
    not possess any knowledge or has no reasonable ground to know while 
    performing or directing to be performed such act in respect of such 
    semiconductor integrated circuit or article that it incorporated a 
    registered layout-design but after the time when such person has received 
    notice of such knowledge, he may continue to perform or directing to be 
    performed such act in respect of the stock on hand or ordered before such 
    time and, then, he shall be liable to pay the proprietor of the registered 
    layout-design a sum by way of royalty to be determined by negotiation 
    between registered proprietor of the registered layout-design and that 
    person or by the Appellate Board having regard to the benefit accrued to 
    such person by performing or directing to be performed such act in respect
