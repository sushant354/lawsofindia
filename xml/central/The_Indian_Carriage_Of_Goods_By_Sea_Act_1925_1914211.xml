    Schedule

(a)  “carrier” includes the owner or the 
    charterer who enters into a contract of carriage with a shipper;
 


(b)  “contract of carriage” applies only 
    to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document 
    of title, in so far as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea 
    including any bill of lading or any similar document as aforesaid issued 
    under or pursuant to a charter party from the moment at which such bill of 
    lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a 
    carrier and a holder of the same;
 


1[(c)  
    “Goods” includes any property including live animals as well as containers, 
    pallets or similar articles of transport or packaging supplied by the 
    consignor, irrespective of whether such property is to be or is carried on 
    or under deck;]
 


(d)  “ship” means any vessel used for the 
    carriage of goods by sea;
 


(e)  “carriage of goods” covers the 
    period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are 
    discharged from the ship.
 

 
 


Article II
 


Risks
 


Subject to the provisions of Article VI, under 
    every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to the 
    loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and discharge of such 
    goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and 
    entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth.
 

 
 

 
 


Article III
 



    Responsibilities and Liabilities
 


1. 
    The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to 
    exercise due diligence to—
 


(a)  make the ship seaworthy;
 


(b)  properly man, equip, and supply the 
    ship;
 


(c)  make the holds, refrigerating and 
    cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, 
    fit and safe for their reception, carriage and preservation.
 


2. 
    Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and 
    carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods 
    carried.
 


3. 
    After receiving the goods into his charge, the carrier or the master or 
    agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper 
    a bill of lading showing among other things—
 


(a)  The leading marks necessary for 
    identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the 
    shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are 
    stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the 
    cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as 
    should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage;
 


(b)  Either the number of packages or 
    pieces, or the quantity, or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in 
    writing by the shipper;
 


(c)  The apparent order and condition of 
    the goods:
 


Provided that no carrier, 
    master or agent of the carrier, shall be bound to state or show in the bill 
    of lading any marks, number, quantity or weight which he has reasonable 
    ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually 
    received, or which he had no reasonable means of checking.
 


4. 
    Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by 
    the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraph 
    (3)(a), (b) and (c). 
1[However, 
    proof to the contrary shall not be admissible when the bill of lading has 
    been transferred to a third party acting in good faith.]
 


5. 
    The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy 
    at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity, and weight, as 
    furnished by him, and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all 
    loss, damages and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such 
    particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way 
    limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any 
    person other than the shipper.
 


6. 
    Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or 
    damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of 
    discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody 
    of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, 
    or, if the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal 
    shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the 
    goods as described in the bill of lading.
 


The notice in writing 
    need not be given if the state of the goods has at the time of their receipt 
    been the subject of joint survey or inspection.
 


In any event the carrier 
    and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or 
    damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or 
    the date when the goods should have been delivered.
 


2[This 
    period may, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause of 
    action has arisen:
 


Provided that a suit may 
    be brought after the expiry of the period of one year referred to in this 
    sub-paragraph within a further period of not more than three months as 
    allowed by the court.]
 


In the case of any actual 
    or apprehended loss or damage, the carrier and the receiver shall give all 
    reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.
 


7. 
    After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, 
    master or agent of the carrier, to the shipper shall, if the shipper so 
    demands, be a “shipped” bill of lading, provided that, if the shipper shall 
    have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall 
    surrender the same as against the issue of the “shipped” bill of lading, but 
    at the option of the carrier, such document of title may be noted at the 
    port of shipment by the carrier, master or agent with the name or names of 
    the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or 
    dates of shipment, and when so noted the same shall for the purpose of this 
    Article be deemed to constitute a “shipped” bill of lading.
 


8. 
    Any clause, covenant or agreement in a contract of  carriage relieving 
    the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in 
    connection with goods arising from negligence, fault or failure in the 
    duties and obligations provided in this Article or lessening such liability 
    otherwise than as provided in these Rules, shall be null and void 
    and of no effect.
 


A benefit of insurance or similar clause shall 
    be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.
 



 


Article IV
 



    Rights and Immunities
 


1. 
    Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising 
    or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on 
    the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the 
    ship is properly manned, equipped and supplied, and to make the holds, 
    refrigerating and cool chambers and all other parts of the ship in which 
    goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage and 
    preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 
    III.
 


Whenever loss or damage has resulted from 
    unseaworthiness the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be 
    on the carrier or other person claiming exemption under this section.
 


2. 
    Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage 
    arising or resulting from—
 
 


(a)  act, neglect, 
      or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or the servants of the carrier 
      in the navigation or in the management of the ship;
 


(b)  fire, unless 
      caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier;
 


(c)  perils, 
      dangers and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters;
 


(d)  act of God;
 


(e)  act of war;
 


(f)  act of public 
      enemies;
 


(g)  arrest or 
      restraint of princes, rulers of people, or seizure under legal process;
 


(h)  quarantine 
      restriction;
 


(i)  act or 
      omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent, or 
      representative;
 


(j)  strikes or 
      lock-outs or stoppage or restraint of labour from whatever cause, whether 
      partial or general;
 


(k)  riots and 
      civil commotions;
 


(l)  saving or 
      attempting to save life or property at sea;
 


(m)  wastage in 
      bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, 
      quality, or vice of the goods;
 


(n)  insufficiency 
      of packing;
 


(o)  insufficiency 
      or inadequacy of marks;
 


(p)  latent 
      defects not discoverable by due diligence;
 


(q)  any other 
      cause arising without the actual fault or privity of the carrier, or 
      without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but 
      the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this 
      exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier 
      nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier 
      contributed to the loss or damage.

 


3. 
    The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the 
    carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, 
    fault or neglect of the shipper, his agents or his servants.
 


4. 
    Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or 
    any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be infringement or breach of 
    these Rules or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be 
    liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.
 


5. 
    Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for 
    any loss or damage to or in connection with goods in an 3[amount 
    exceeding 666.67 Special Drawing Rights per package or unit or two Special 
    Drawing Rights per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged, 
    whichever is higher], or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, 
    unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper 
    before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.
 


4[Where 
    a container, pallet or similar article of transport is used to consolidate 
    goods, the number of packages or units enumerated in the bill of lading and 
    as packed in such article of transport shall be deemed to be the number of 
    packages or units for the purposes of this paragraph as far as these 
    packages or units are concerned.
 


Neither the carrier nor 
    the ship shall be entitled to the benefit of limitation of liability 
    provided for in this paragraph if it is proved that the damage resulted from 
    an act or omission of the carrier done with intent to cause damage, or 
    recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.
 


Where the nature or value 
    of the goods has been knowingly mis-stated by the shipper in the bill of 
    lading, the liability of the carrier or ship shall not exceed the value so 
    stated.]
 


This declaration if 
    embodied in the bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence, but 
    shall not be binding or conclusive on the carrier.
 


By agreement between the 
    carrier, master or agent of the carrier and the shipper another maximum 
    amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed, provided that 
    such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named.
 


Neither the carrier nor 
    the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to or in 
    connection with goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowningly mis-stated 
    by the shipper in the bill of lading.
 


6. 
    Goods of an inflammable, explosive or dangerous nature to the shipment 
    whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented, with 
    knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be 
    landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier 
    without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all 
    damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from 
    such shipment.
 


If any such goods shipped with such knowledge 
    and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like 
    manner be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the 
    carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general 
    average, if any.
 

 
 


Article V
 



    Surrender of Rights and Immunities Increase of Responsibilities and 
    Liabilities
 


A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in 
    whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any 
    of his responsibilities and liabilities under the Rules contained in any of 
    these Articles, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the 
    bill of lading issued to the shipper.
 


The provisions of these Rules  shall not 
    be applicable to charter-parties, but if bills of lading are issued in the 
    case of a ship under a charter-party, they shall comply with the terms of 
    these Rules. Nothing in these Rules shall be held, to prevent the insertion 
    in a bill of lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.
 



 


Article VI 

Special Conditions
 


Notwithstanding the provisions of the 
    preceding Articles, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier, and a shipper 
    shall, in regard to any particular goods, be at liberty to enter into any 
    agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier 
    for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in 
    respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness so far as the 
    stipulation is not contrary to public policy, or the care or diligence of 
    his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, 
    carriage, custody, care, and discharge of the goods carried by sea, provided 
    that in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the 
    terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a non-negotiable 
    document and shall be marked as such.
 


Any agreement so entered into shall have full 
    legal effect:
 


Provided that this Article shall not apply to 
    ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade, but only 
    to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be 
    carried or the circumstances, terms and conditions under which the carriage 
    is to be performed, as such are reasonably to justify a special agreement.
 

 
 


Article VII 

Limitations on 
    the Application of the Rules
 


Nothing herein contained shall prevent a 
    carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, 
    condition, reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability 
    of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in connection with 
    the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and 
    subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by 
    sea.
 

 
 


Article VIII 

Limitation of 
    Liability
 


The provisions of these Rules shall not affect 
    the right and obligation of the carrier under any Statute for the time being 
    in force relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of sea-going 
    vessels.

The monetary units mentioned in these Rules 
    are to be taken to be gold value.
