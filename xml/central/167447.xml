Power of court to release certain offenders on probation of good conduct.—
<section><number>1</number>
When any person is found guilty of having committed an offence not punishable
with death or imprisonment for life and the court by which the person is found
guilty is of opinion that, having regard to the circumstances of the case
including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is
expedient to release him on probation of good conduct, then, notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the court may,
instead of sentencing him at once to any punishment direct that he be released
on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive
sentence when called upon during such period, not exceeding three years, as the
court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour:

 Provided
that the court shall not direct such release of an offender unless it is
satisfied that the offender or his surety, if any, has a fixed place of abode or
regular occupation in the place over which the court exercises jurisdiction or
in which the offender is likely to live during the period for which he enters
into the bond. 
 </section><section><number>2</number>
Before making any order under sub-section (1), the court shall take into
consideration the report, if any, of the probation officer concerned in relation
to the case. 
 </section><section><number>3</number>
When an order under sub-section (1) is made, the court may, if it is of opinion
that in the interests of the offender and of the public it is expedient so to
do, in addition pass a supervision order directing that the offender shall
remain under the supervision of a probation officer named in the order during
such period, not being less than one year, as may be specified therein, and may
in such supervision order, impose such conditions as it deems necessary for the
due supervision of the offender. 
 </section><section><number>4</number>
The court making a supervision order under sub-section (3) shall require the
offender, before he is released, to enter into a bond, with or without sureties,
to observe the conditions specified in such order and such additional conditions
with respect to residence, abstention from intoxicants or any other matter as
the court may, having regard to the particular circumstances, consider fit to
impose for preventing a repetition of the same offence or a commission of other
offences by the offender. 
 </section><section><number>5</number>
The court making a supervision order under sub-section (3) shall explain to the
offender the terms and conditions of the order and shall forthwith furnish one
copy of the supervision order to each of the offenders, the sureties, if any,
and the probation officer concerned.

caused to any person by the commission of the offence; and 
 </subsection><subsection><number>b</number>

Restrictions on imprisonment of offenders under twenty-one years of age.—
<section><number>1</number>
When any person under twenty-one years of age is found guilty of having
committed an offence punishable with imprisonment (but not with imprisonment for
life), the court by which the person is found guilty shall not sentence him to
imprisonment unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of
the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender,
it would not be desirable to deal with him under section 3 or section 4, and if
the court passes any sentence of imprisonment on the offender, it shall record
its reasons for doing so. 
 </section><section><number>2</number>
For the purpose of satisfying itself whether it would not be desirable to deal
under section 3 or section 4 with an offender referred to in sub-section (1) the
court shall call for a report from the probation officer and consider the
report, if any, and any other information available to it relating to the
character and physical and mental condition of the offender.

Report of probation officer to be confidential.—The
report of a probation officer referred to in sub-section (2) of section 4 or
sub-section (2) of section 6 shall be treated as confidential :

the offender and may give him an opportunity of producing such evidence as may
be relevant to the matter stated in the report.

 <article><title><number>8</number> Variation of conditions of probation. </title>-
<section><number>1</number> If, on the application of a probation officer, any court which passes an order under section 4 in respect of an offender is of opinion that in the interests of the offender and the public it is expedient or necessary to vary the conditions of any bond entered into by the offender, it may, at any time during the period when the bond is effective, vary the bond by extending or diminishing the duration thereof so, however, that it shall not exceed three years from the date of the original order or by altering the conditions thereof or by inserting additional conditions therein: 
 Provided that no such variation shall be made without giving the offender and the surety or sureties mentioned in the bond an opportunity of being heard. 
 </section><section><number>2</number> If any surety refuses to consent to any variation proposed to be made under sub-section (1), the court may require the offender to enter into a fresh bond and if the offender refuses or fails to do so, the court may sentence him for the offence of which he was found guilty. 
 </section><section><number>3</number> Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, the court which passes an order under section 4 in respect of an offender may, if it is satisfied on an application made by the probation officer, that the conduct of the offender has been such as to make it unnecessary that he should be kept any longer under supervision, discharge the bond or bonds entered into by him.

 <article><number>9</number> Procedure in case of offender failing to 
      observe conditions of bond.—
<section><number>1</number> 
      If the court which passes an order under section 4 in respect of an 
      offender or any court which could have dealt with the offender in respect 
      of his original offence has reason to believe, on the report of a 
      probation officer or otherwise, that the offender has failed to observe 
      any of the conditions of the bond or bonds entered into by him, it may 
      issue a warrant for his arrest or may, if it thinks fit, issue a summons 
      to him and his sureties, if any, requiring him or them to attend before it 
      at such time as may be specified in the summons. 
 </section><section><number>2</number> The court before which an offender is so 
      brought or appears may either remand him to custody until the case is 
      concluded or it may grant him bail, with or without surety, to appear on 
      the date which it may fix for hearing. 
 </section><section><number>3</number> If the court, after hearing the case, is 
      satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of 
      the bond or bonds entered into by him, it may forthwith—
 <subsection><number>a</number>
sentence him for the original offence; or
 </subsection><subsection><number>b</number>
where the failure is for the first time, then, without prejudice to 
      the continuance in force of the bond, impose upon him a penalty not 
      exceeding fifty rupees.
 </subsection></section><section><number>4</number> If a penalty imposed under clause (b) of 
      sub-section (3) is not paid within such period as the court may fix, the 
      court may sentence the offender for the original offence.

before it on appeal or in revision. 
 </section><section><number>2</number>
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, where an order under section 3
or section 4 is made by any court trying the offender (other than a High Court),
an appeal shall lie to the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the
sentences of the former court. 
 </section><section><number>3</number>
In any case where any person under twenty-one years of age is found guilty of
having committed an offence and the court by which he is found guilty declines
to deal with him under section 3 or section 4, and passes against him any
sentence of imprisonment with or without fine from which no appeal lies or is
preferred, then, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or any other
law, the court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of the former
court may, either of its own motion or on an application made to it by the
convicted person or the probation officer, call for and examine the record of
the case and pass such order thereon as it thinks fit. 
 </section><section><number>4</number>
When an order has been made under section 3 or section 4 in respect of an
offender, the Appellate Court or the High Court in the exercise of its power of
revision may set aside such order and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such
offender according to law: 
 Provided
that the Appellate Court or the High Court in revision shall not inflict a
greater punishment than might have been inflicted by the court by which the
offender was found guilty.
