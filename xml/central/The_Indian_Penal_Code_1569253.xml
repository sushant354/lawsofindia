    act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.   
  
 
Illustration
 
A attacks Z under 
    such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would 
    be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will 
    towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to 
    the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A 
    and B are both engaged in causing Z’s death, B is 
    guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.

A sets fire, by night, to 
    an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a

    intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by 
    his act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused 
    death voluntarily.

<number>81</number> Act 
    likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other 
    harm.—Nothing is an offence 
    merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to 
    cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and 
    in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person 
    or property.
 

    Explanation.—It is question of 
    fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such 
    a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act 
    with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.

    on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing 
    his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two 
    passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters 
    his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good 
    faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat
    B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat 
    C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it 
    be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was 
    such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.

    Abetment of a thing.—A person

<number>First</number>—     Instigates 
    any person to do that thing; or   
 </section><section>
<number>Secondly</number>—Engages 
    with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of

 </section><section>
<number>Thirdly</number>—  Intentionally 
    aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.  
 
Explanation 
    1.—A person who, by wilful 
    misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is 
    bound to dis­close, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or 
    procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.  
  
 

    Illustration
 
A, a public officer, is 
    authorized by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, 
    knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully 
    represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally 
    causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation 
    the apprehension of C.
 

Explanation 2.—Whoever, 
    either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in 
    order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitate the 
    commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.

    Abettor.—A person abets an 
    offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of 
    an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of 
    commit­ting an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the 
    abettor.   
 
Explanation 
    1.—The abetment of the illegal 
    omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not 
    himself be bound to do that act.   
 
Explanation 
    2.—To constitute the offence of 
    abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or 
    that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.

    to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D.
    D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B 
    to commit murder.
 
Explanation 
    3.—It is not necessary that the 
    person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he 
    should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, 
    or any guilty intention or knowledge.

 </section><section>
<number>a</number> A, with a guilty 
    intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an 
    offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, 
    and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be 
    committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.
 </section><section>
<number>b</number> A, with the intention 
    of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of 
    age, to do an act which causes Z’s death. B, in consequence of 
    the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes 
    Z’s death. Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an 
    offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B 
    had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, 
    and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
 </section><section>
<number>c</number> A instigates B 
    to set fire to a dwelling-house, B, in conse­quence of the 
    unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, 
    or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house 
    in consequence of A’s instigation. B has committed no offence, 
    but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a 
    dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment, provided for that offence.
    
 </section><section>
<number>d</number> A, intending to cause 
    a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to
    Z out of Z’s possession. A induces B to believe 
    that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of 
    Z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A’s property.
    B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and 
    therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, 
    and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
    
  
 
Explanation 
    4.—The abetment of an offence 
    being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also as offence.
      
 
Illustration
 
A instigates B to 
    instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly insti­gates C 
    to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of 
    B’s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with 
    the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit 
    the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.
  
 
Explanation 
    5.—It is not necessary to the 
    commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should 
    concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he 
    engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.  
 
Illustration
 
A concerts with B 
    a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer 
    the poison. B then explains the plan to C men­tioning that a 
    third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A’s 
    name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to
    B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A 
    administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A 
    and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in 
    the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C 
    has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to 
    the punishment for murder.

    A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it A,

    A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B

    as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act 
    that he knew was likely to cause death. 
 

    Explanation 1.—A 
    person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a 
    disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of 
    that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.

    shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper 
    remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.  
 

    Explanation 3.—The 
    causing of the death of child in the mother’s womb is not homicide. But it 
    may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any 
    part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have 
    breathed or been completely born.

    Exception 1.—When 
    culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the 
    offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden 
    provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or 
    causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.

    amounting to murder is a question of fact.

    and kills Z. This is murder.
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>e</number>
    A attempts to pull Z’s nose, Z, in the exercise of the 
    right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing 
    so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and 
    kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a 
    thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
 </subsection><subsection>
<number>f</number>
    Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage.
    A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B’s rage, and 
    to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that 
    purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have 
    committed only culpable homi­cide, but A is guilty of murder.
 

    Exception 2.—Culpable 
    homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the 
    right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to 
    him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising 
    such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of 
    doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.  
  
 


    Illustration
 

    Z attempts to 
    horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A.
    A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A 
    believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from 
    being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, 
    but only culpable homicide.
 

    Exception 3.—Culpable 
    homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a 
    public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the 
    powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in 
    good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his 
    duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose 
    death is caused.  
 

    Exception 4.—Culpable 
    homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden 
    fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender 
    having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.  
 

    Explanation.—It 
    is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits 
    the first assault.  
 

    Exception 5.—Culpable 
    homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above 
    the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his 
    own consent.  
  
 


    Illustration
 

    A, by 
    instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of 
    age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z’s youth, he was 
    incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted 
    murder.

      this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced 
      without any other act on any person’s part. A has there­fore 
      intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s 
      consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or in­tending or

<number>351</number> Assault.—Whoever 
    makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely 
    that such gesture or prepa­ration will cause any person present to apprehend 
    that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force 
    to that person, is said to commit an assault.
 

Explanation.—Mere 
    words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may 
    give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those 
    gestures or preparations amount to an assault.

<number>352</number> Punishment for 
    assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever 
    assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and 
    sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment 
    of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with 
    fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.  
 

Explanation.—Grave 
    and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under 
    this section. If the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the 
    offender as an excuse for the offence, or  
 

    if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by 
    a public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public 
    servant, or   
 

    if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exer­cise of the 
    right of private defence.  
 

    Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, 
    is a question of fact.

      STATE AMENDMENT
 





 



</section><section>

<number>Manipur</number>—In 
      section 361 for the words ‘eighteen’ substitute the word ‘fifteen’.  
 
[Vide 
      Manipur Act 30 of 1950, sec. 3 (w.e.f. 16-4-1950), read with Act 81 of 
      1971, sec. 3 (w.e.f. 25-1-1972)].  
  
 


      COMMENTS  
 

Inducement not 
      immediate cause  
 

       The accused was charged for kidnapping a minor girl, below 15 years of 
      age from the lawful guardianship of her father. It was established that 
      the accused had an earlier stage solicited or induced minor girl to leave 
      her father’s protection by conveying or indicating an encouraging 
      suggestion, that he would give her shelter. Holding the accused liable for 
      kidnapping under section 363, the Supreme Court said that the mere 
      circumstances that his act was not the immediate cause of her leaving her 
      parental home or guardian’s custody would constitute no valid defence and 
      would not absolve him from the offence of kidnapping. The question truly 
      falls for determination on the facts and circumstances of each case; 
      Thakorilal D Vadgama v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1973 SC 2314: 
      (1973) 2 SCC 413.  
 

Lawful guardian 
  
 

      Where facts indicate that a girl left her father’s protection, knowing and 
      having capacity to know the full import of what she was doing and 
      voluntarily joined the accused, the offence of kidnapping cannot  be 
      said to have been made out; S. Varadrajan v. State of Madras, 
      AIR 1965 SC 942.  
 

Use of word ‘keeping’: 
      Meaning of  
 

      The use of the word “keeping” in the context connotes the idea of charge, 
      protection, maintenance and control; further the guardian’s charge and 
      control appears to be compatible with the independence of action and 
      movement in the minor, the guardian’s protection and control of the minor 
      being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this 
      section the consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly 
      immaterial: it is only the guardian’s consent which takes the case out of 
      its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or enticing must be shown 
      to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the accused person 
      which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the 
      keeping of the lawful guardian would be sufficient to attract the section;

    such taking, is said to commit theft.

Explanation 2.—A 
    moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may be a theft.  
 

Explanation 3.—A

    prevented it from moving or by sepa­rating it from any other thing, as well 
    as by actually moving it.

      <number>a</number> A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of 
      dis­honestly taking the tree out of Z’s possession without Z’s 
      con­sent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such 
      taking, he has committed theft.

      <number>b</number> A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s 
      dog to follow it. Here, if A’s intention be dishonestly to take the 
      dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A has 
      commit­ted theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.
 </section><section>

      <number>c</number> A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the 
      bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the 
      treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed 
      theft of the treasure.
 </section><section>

      <number>d</number> A, being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the 
      care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without 
      Z’s consent. A has committed theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>e</number> Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the 
      keeper of the warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the 
      plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s 
      possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, 
      and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed 
      criminal breach of trust.
 </section><section>

      <number>f</number> A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house 
      which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z’s possession, and if
      A dishonest­ly removes it, A commits theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>g</number> A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of 
      any person. A by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit 
      criminal misappropriation of property.
 </section><section>

      <number>h</number> A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s 
      house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of 
      search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is 
      highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the 
      intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the 
      loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, 
      commits theft.
 </section><section>
<number>i</number>
      A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z 
      carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for 
      which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters 
      the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and 
      carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi­nal 
      trespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did 
      was not done dishonestly.
 </section><section>

      <number>j</number> If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if 
      Z re­tains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A 
      takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of 
      depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits 
      theft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.
 </section><section>

      <number>k</number> Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out 
      of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, not having paid what 
      he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own 
      property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.
 </section><section>

      <number>l</number> A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s 
      possession, without Z’s consent, with the intention of keeping it 
      until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here
      A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>m</number> A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s 
      library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book without Z’s 
      express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the 
      intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have 
      conceived that he had Z’s implied consent to use Z’s book. 
      If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>n</number> A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, 
      food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. 
      Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is 
      authorised to give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A 
      has not committed theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>o</number> A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable 
      property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to 
      be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A 
      takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.
 </section><section>

      <number>p</number> A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to 
      be A’s own property, takes that property out of B’s 
      possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not 
      commit theft.

      The delay in hearing of appeal for long period is no cause for not 
      interfering with an order of acquittal which was based on conjectures and 
      surmises, resulting in gross failure of justice; State of Rajasthan 
      v. Shanker, 2000 Cr LJ 266 (Raj).  
 

Taking need not be 
      permanent  
 

      It is not necessary that the taking should be of a permanent character, or 
      that the accused should have derived any profit. A temporary removal of an 
      office file from the office of a Chief Engineer and making it available to 
      a private person for a day or two amounts to the offence of theft;

<number>390</number> Robbery.—In 
    all robbery there is either theft or extortion.  
 

When theft is 
    robbery.—Theft 
    is “robbery” if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing 
    the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained 
    by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to 
    cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant 
    death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint.  
 

When extortion is 
    robbery.—Extortion 
    is “robbery” if the offend­er, at the time of committing the extortion, is 
    in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by 
    putting that person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant 
    wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, and, by so 
    putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver 
    up the thing extorted.  
 

Explanation.—The 
    offender is said to be present if he is suffi­ciently near to put the other 
    person in fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful 
    restraint.

      and jewels from Z’s clothes without Z’s consent. Here A 
      has committed theft, and in order to the committing of that theft, has 
      voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore 
      committed rob­bery.
 </section><section>

      <number>b</number> A meets Z on the high roads, shows a pistol, and demands
      Z’s purse. Z in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A 
      has extort­ed the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant 
      hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. A 
      has therefore committed robbery.
 </section><section>

      <number>c</number> A meets Z and Z’s child on the high road. A 
      takes the child and threatens to fling it down a precipice, unless Z 
      delivers his purse. Z, in consequence delivers his purse. Here A 
      has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of 
      instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore 
      committed robbery on Z.
 </section><section>

      <number>d</number> A obtains property from Z by saying—“Your child is in 
      the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us ten 
      thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such; but it is not 
      robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of his child.

      In order that theft may constitute robbery, prosecution has to establish—

      In other words, theft would only be robbery if for any of the ends 
      mentioned in (a) to (c) the offender voluntarily causes or at­tempts to 
      cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant 
      death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint. If the ends does 
      not fall within (a) to (c) but, the offender still causes or attempts to 
      cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant 
      death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, the offence would 
      not be robbery. That (a) or (b) or (c) have to be read conjunctively with 
      (d) and (e). It is only when (a) or (b) or (c) co-exist with (d) and (e) 
      or there is a nexus between any of them and (d), (e) would amount to 
      robbery; State of Maharashtra v. Joseph Mingel Koli, (1997)

      A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the 
      property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.

      <number>b</number> A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s 
      library in Z’s absence, and takes away a book without Z’s 
      express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had 
      Z’s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, 
      A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book 
      for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
 </section><section>

      <number>c</number> A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes 
      the horse out of B’s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A 
      has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. 
      But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to 
      his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
 

Explanation I.—A 
      dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the 
      meaning of this section.  
  
 

Illustration
 

A 
      finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank 
      endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges 
      it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to 
      restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this 
      section.
 

Explanation 2.—A 
      person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and 
      takes such property for the purpose of protecting if for, or of restoring 
      it to, the owner does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is 
      not guilty of an of­fence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, 
      if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of 
      discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover 
      and give notice to the owner and has kept the proper­ty a reasonable time 
      to enable the owner to claim it.  
 

      What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is 
      a question of fact.  
 

      It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the 
      property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is 
      sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to 
      be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot 
      be found.

      comments  
 

Dishonest 
      misappropriation or conversion of property  
 

      The words ’converts to his own use’ necessarily connote the use or dealing 
      with the property in derogation of the rights of the owner; Ramaswami 
      Nadar v. State of Madras, AIR 1958 SC 56.  
 

Ingreidents  
 

      It has been held that the word ‘dishonestly’ and ‘misappropriate’ are 
      necessary ingredients of an offence under section 403. Any dispute being 
      about recovery of money is purely of civil nature. Hence a criminal 
      complaint regarding such a matter is not maintainable, U. Dhar v.
      State of 
Jharkhand, 
      AIR 2003 SC 974.

      Comments
 

Criminal Conspiracy  
 

      Sanction for prosecution is not necessary if a public servant is charged 
      for offence of entering into a criminal conspiracy for committed breach of 
      trust; State of Kerala v. Padmanabham Nair, 1999 Cr LJ 3696 
      (SC).  
 

Criminal breach of 
      trust: Meaning and extent  
 
It must be proved that 
      the beneficial interest in the property in respect of which the offence is 
      alleged to have been committed was vested in some person other than the 
      accused, and that the accused held that property on behalf of that person. 
      A relationship 
      is created between the transferor and transferee, whereunder the 
      transferor remains the owner of the property and the transferee has legal 
      custody of the property for the benefit of the transferor himself or 
      transferee has only the custody of the property for the benefit of the 
      transferor himself or someone else. At best, the transferee obtains in the 
      property entrusted to him only special interest limited to claim for his 
      charges in respect of its safe retention, and under no circumstances does 
      he acquire a right to dispose of that property in contravention of the 
      condition of the entrustment; Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. 
      State of Bombay, AIR 1956 SC 575.  
 

Entrustment  
 

      The word entrusted in the section is very important unless there is 
      entrustment, there can be no offence under the section; Ramaswami Nadar
      v. State of Madras, AIR 1958 SC 56.

<number>425</number> Mischief.—Whoever 
    with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss 
    or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any 
    property, or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as 
    destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, 
    commits “mischief”.  
 

Explanation 1.—It 
    is not essential to the offence of mischief that the offender should intend 
    to cause loss or damage to the owner of the property injured or destroyed. 
    It is sufficient if he intends to cause, or knows that he is likely to 
    cause, wrong­ful loss or damage to any person by injuring any property, 
    wheth­er it belongs to that person or not.  
 

Explanation 2.—Mischief 
    may be committed by an act affecting property belonging to the person who 
    commits the act, or to that person and others jointly.

 Illustrations 
 <section><number>a</number> A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000 
written by Z . A , in order to defraud B , adds a 
cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be 
believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has 
committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>b</number> A , without Z 's authority, affixes Z 's seal 
to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to 
A , with the intention of selling the estate to B , and 
thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has 
committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>c</number> A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B , payable 
to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A 
fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand 
rupees. A commits forgery. 
 </section><section><number>d</number> A leaves with B , his agent, a cheque on a banker, 
signed by A , without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B 
to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees 
for the purpose of making certain payment. B fraudulently fills up the 
cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits 
forgery. 
 </section><section><number>e</number> A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B 
with­out B 's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine 
bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as 
A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to 
suppose that he had the security of B , and thereby to discount the 
bill, A is guilty of forgery. 
 </section><section><number>f</number> Z 's will contains the these words—“I direct that all my 
remaining property be equally divided between A , B and C 
.” A dishonestly scratches out B 's name, intending that 
it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C . A 
has commit­ted forgery. 
 </section><section><number>g</number> A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to 
Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or 
his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words 
“Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement 
into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. 
 </section><section><number>h</number> A sells and conveys an estate to Z . A 
afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a 
conveyance of the same estate to B , dated six months earlier than the 
date of the conveyance to Z , intending it to be believed that he had 
conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z . A 
has committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>i</number> Z dictates his will to A . A intentionally 
writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z , and by 
represent­ing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his 
instruc­tions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed 
forgery. 
 </section><section><number>j</number> A writes a letter and signs it with B 's name without 
B 's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character 
and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means 
of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A 
made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property. 
A has committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>k</number> A without B 's authority writes a letter and signs it 
in B 's name certifying to A 's character, intending thereby 
to obtain employment under Z . A has committed forgery in as 
much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby 
to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for 
serv­ice. 
 Explanation 1. —A man's signature of his own name may amount to 
forgery. 
 Illustrations 
 </section><section><number>a</number> A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it 
may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. 
A has committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>b</number> A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it 
with Z 's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the 
paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z , and negotiate the 
bill as though it had been accepted by Z . A is guilty of 
forgery; and if B , knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper 
pursuant to A 's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. 
 </section><section><number>c</number> A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a 
different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, 
intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person whose 
order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. 
 </section><section><number>d</number> A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against 
B . B , after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with 
Z , executes a lease of the estate of Z at a nominal rent and 
for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the sei­zure, with 
intent to defraud A , and to cause it to be believed that the lease was 
granted before the seizure. B , though he executes the lease in his own 
name, commits forgery by antedating it. 
 </section><section><number>e</number> A , a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with 
B for A 's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; 
and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a prom­issory note 
binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the 
note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before. A was 
on the point of insolvency. A has commit­ted forgery under the 
first head of the definition. 
 Explanation 2. —The making of a false document in the name of a 
fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a 
real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed 
that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. 

 Illustration 
 A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and 
fraudu­lently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with 
intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.

      the cases hereinafter expected, to defame that person.  
 Explanation 
      1.—It may amount to defamation to

      caste or of his calling, or lowers the credit of that person, or causes it 
      to be believed that the body of that person is in a loathsome state, or in 
      a state generally considered as disgrace­ful.

 First 
        Exception.—Imputation of 
        truth which public good requires to be made or published.—It is not 
        defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it

        in as much as the opinion which he expresses of Z respects 
        Z’s character only so far as it appears in Z’s book, and 
        no further.
 </section><section><number>e</number> But if A says—“I am

        opinion not founded on Z’s book.
 Seventh 
        Exception.—Censure passed in 
        good faith by person having lawful authority over another.—It is not 
        defamation in a person having over another any authority, either 
        conferred by law or arising out of a lawful contract made with that

        exception.
 Eighth 
        Exception.—Accusation 
        preferred in good faith to autho­rised person.—It is not 
        defamation to prefer in good faith an accusation against any person to 
        any of those who have lawful authority over that person with respect to 
        the subject-matter of accusation.

 comments
 Moral guilt and 
        injury  
 Section 511 is a general 
        provision dealing with attempts to commit offences not made punishable 
        by other specific sections. It makes punishable all attempts to commit 
        offences punishable with imprisonment and not only those punishable with 
        death. An attempt is made punishable, because every attempt, although it 
        falls short of success, must create alarm, which by itself is an injury, 
        and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded. 
        Moral guilt must be united to injury in order to justify punishment. As 
        the injury is not as great as if the act had been committed, only half 
        the punishment is awarded. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to 
        begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do 
        something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a 
        step towards the commission of the offence. The moment culprit commences 
        to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to 
        commit the offence. The word “attempt” is not itself defined, and must, 
        therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the 
        provisions of section 511 require; Koppula Venkat Rao v. State 
        of Andhra Pradesh, (2004) 3 SCC 602.</section>
