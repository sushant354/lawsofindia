 </subsection><subsection>       <number>d</number>  If it appears on the face of the instrument 
that the execution of it in the manner intended by the testator was not

 Provided that the Will, as so 
altered, shall be deemed to be duly executed if the signature of the testator

the testator and of his family, and into every fact a knowledge of which may

legatees sufficiently show what is meant, an error in the name or description 
shall not prevent the legacy from taking effect.

 <article><number>78</number> Rejection of erroneous 
particulars in description of subject.—If 
the thing which the testator intended to bequeath can be sufficiently 
identified from the description of it given in the Will, but some parts of the 
description do not apply, such parts of the description shall be rejected as 
erroneous, and the bequest shall take effect.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> A bequeaths to B “my marsh-lands lying in
L and in the occupation of X”. The testator had marsh-lands lying 
in L but had no marsh-lands in the occupation of X. The words “in 
the occupation of X” shall be rejected as erroneous, and the marsh-lands 
of the testator lying in L will pass by the bequest.
 </section><section><number>ii</number> The testator bequeaths to A “my zamindari of 
Rampur”. He had an estate at Rampur but it was a taluq and not a zamindari. The 
taluq passes by this bequest.

THE INDIAN SUCCESSION ACT, 1925 
  
 <article><number>79</number> When part of description 
may not be rejected as erroneous.—If 
a Will mentions several circumstances as descriptive of the thing which the 
testator intends to bequeath, and there is any property of his in respect of 
which all those circumstances exist, the bequest shall be considered as limited 
to such property, and it shall not be lawful to reject any part of the 
description as erroneous, because the testator had other property to which such 
part of the description does not apply.
 Explanation.—In 
judging whether a case falls within the meaning of this section, any words 
which would be liable to rejection under section 78 shall be deemed to have 
been struck out of the Will.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> A bequeaths to B “my marsh-lands lying in
L and in the occupation of X”. The testator had marsh-lands lying 
in L, some of which were in the occupation of X, and some not in 
the occupation of X. The bequest will be considered as limited to such 
of the testator’s marsh-lands lying in L as were in the occupation of 
X.
 </section><section><number>ii</number> A bequeaths to B “my marsh-lands lying in
L and in the occupation of X, comprising 1,000 bighas of lands”. 
The testator had marsh-lands lying in L some of which were in the 
occupation of X and some not in the occupation of X. The 
assessment is wholly inapplicable to the marsh-lands of either class, or to the 
whole taken together. The measurement will be considered as struck out of the 
Will, and such of the testator’s marsh-lands lying in L as were in the 
occupation of X shall alone pass by the bequest.

 <article><number>80</number> Entrinsic evidence 
admissible in cases of patent ambiguity.—Where 
the words of a Will are unambiguous, but it is found by extrinsic evidence that 
they admit of application, one only of which can have been intended by the 
testator, extrinsic evidence may be taken to show which of these applications 
was intended.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> A man, having two cousins of the name of Mary, bequeaths 
a sum of money to “my cousin Mary”. It appears that there are two persons, each 
answering the description in the Will. That description, therefore, admits of 
two applications, only one of which can have been intended by the testator. 
Evidence is admissible to show which of the two applications was intended.
 </section><section><number>ii</number> A, by his Will leaves to B “my estate

Khurd. Evidence is admissible to show which state was intended.

inadmissible in case of patent ambiguity or deficiency.—Where

evidence as to the intentions of the testator shall be admitted.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> A man has an aunt, Caroline, and a cousin, Mary, and has 
no aunt of the name of Mary. By his Will he bequeaths 1,000 rupees to “my aunt, 
Caroline” and 1,000 rupees to “my cousin, Mary” and afterwards bequeaths 2,000 
rupees to “my before-mentioned aunt, Mary”. There is no person to whom the 
description given in the will can apply, and evidence is not admissible to show 
who was meant by “my before-mentioned aunt, Mary”. The bequest is, therefore, 
void for uncertainty under section 89.

collected from entire Will.—The 
meaning of any clause in a Will is to be collected from the entire instrument, 
and all its parts are to be construed with reference to each other.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> The testator gives to B a specific fund or 
property at the death of A, and by a subsequent clause gives the whole 
of his property to A. The effect of the several clauses taken together 
is to vest the specific fund or property in A for life, and after his 
decease in B; it appearing from the bequest to B that the 
testator meant to use in a restricted sense the words in which he describes 
what he gives to A.
 </section><section><number>ii</number> Where a testator having an estate, one part of which is 
called Black Acre, bequeaths the whole of his estate to A, and in 
another part of his will bequeaths Black Acre to B, the latter bequest 
is to be read as an exception out of the first as if he had said “I give Black 
Acre to B, and all the rest of my estate to A”.

words may be understood in a restricted sense where it may be collected from 
the Will that the testator meant to use them in a restricted sense; and words 
may be understood in a wider sense than that which they usually bear, where it 
may be collected from the other words of the will that the testator meant to 
use them in such wider sense.
 Illustrations
 <section><number>i</number> A testator gives to A “my farm in the occupation 
of B”, and to C “all my marsh-lands in L”. Part of the 
farm in the occupation of B consists of marsh-lands in L, and the 
testator also has other marsh-lands in L. The general words, “all my 
marsh-lands in L”, are restricted by the gift to A. A takes the 
whole of the farm in the occupation of B, including that portion of the 
farm which consists of marsh-lands in L.

to his son, B, for his own absolute use and benefit. B dies 
before A, leaving a son, C, who survives A, and having 
made his Will whereby he bequeaths all his property to his widow, D. The

 comment
 Section 118 comes within the purview of articles 14 and 15 
of the Constitution of India and it is, therefore, necessary that all testators 
who are similarly situated should be subjected to the same rule of procedure. 
There cannot be any unusual burden of Christian testators alone when all other 
testators, making similar bequests for similar charities and similar religious 
purposes are not subjected to such procedure. Therefore section 118 is 
anomalous, discriminatory and violative of articles 14, 15, 25 and 26 of 
Constitution.
 The Court in exercise of its jurisdiction and to remedy 
the violation of fundamental rights, declared this section as invalid and 
unconstitutional; John Vallamattom v. Union of India, (2003) 6

 <article><number>119</number> Date of vesting of 
legacy when payment or possession postponed.—Where 
by the terms of a bequest the legatee is not entitled to immediate possession 
of the thing bequeathed, a right to receive it at the proper time shall, unless 
a contrary intention appears by the Will, become vested in the legatee on the 
testator’s death, and shall pass to the legatee’s representatives if he dies 
before that time and without having received the legacy, and in such cases the 
legacy is from the testator’s death said to be vested in interest.
 Explanation.—An 
intention that a legacy to any person shall not become vested in interest in 
him is not to be inferred merely from a provision whereby the payment or 
possession of the thing bequeathed is postponed, or whereby a prior interest 
therein is bequeathed to some other person, or whereby the income arising from 
the fund bequeathed is directed to be accumulated until the time of payment 
arrives, or from a provision that, if a particular event shall happen, the 
legacy shall go over to another person.
